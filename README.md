# Mechanical-keyboard-for-ZX81plus38
this is a keyboard with large sherry MX1A-E1NW blue stem keys as an alternative to the small keyboard (same size as the real ZX81 keyboard).
this keyboard is a high quality mechanical with a good feel, and a mechanical click for feedback
it is much larger than the tiny keyboard with 3 x 3mm keys, so it is NOT suitable to build into a ZX81 enclosure.
it is designed to be flush with the left side of the ZX-81, so that an enclosure designed for the keyboard and the ZX81plus38 PCB will fit, with empty space in the enclosure on the right hand side.
the connector of the keyboard, and the ZX81plus38 will then be alligned correctly, so a straight flatcable can be used to connect the two.
The joystick port can be extended to the outside of the enclosure (back side or right side) with a short cable.
